# iRecycler App Building

This is the final project for DSCI 551 Foundations of Data Management @USC.

My partner and I aim to build an information platform about re-leasing, re-sale and other demands within a certain area (for example ktown, downtown, DPS and other places near USC), hoping it can help corresponding users exchange information effectively and save time and money. For details, you can go to `Project Proposal.pdf`.

Some ideas:
- Use Firebase to store the data
- Develop a Web-based UI

What we want to achieve:
- Information exchange
- Environmental protection
- Resource recycling
- Social networking

This group project will span the entire semester, so the progress will be updated regularly.
- `Project Prosal.pdf` completed on Feb. 7

Thank you :)
